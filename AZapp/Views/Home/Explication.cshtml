This is how this site works:

<ul>
    <li>You go to <a asp-controller="member" asp-action="Create">Create my wishlist</a></li>
    <li>You choose which member PCs you want to look at.</li>
    <li>Under each PC picture you choose either if you already have it, if you want it or if you want it on your top priority list.</li>
    <li>Don't forget to save at the end of the page. It will return you to the page where you can choose another member top look at.</li>
    <li>When you have selected all the PCs you want on your wishlist, you click on Download the pdf. It will in fact download a .zip file, 
        which contains a pdf with the pictures of the PCs in each category that you can use on your social medias, and a .txt file.</li>
    <li>The .txt file is used in the <a asp-controller="member" asp-action="Update">Update</a> part of this site. You upload this file on
        the page and submit it. Then you will be lead to the same page as when you want to create your wishlist, except the choices you made 
        last time are saved up.</li>
    <li>If you have any question don't hesitate to contact <a asp-controller="member" asp-action="Contact">me</a>.</li>
</ul>

You have to know that the unit PCs (that features 2 members or more) are shown on each member page, so you can choose them twice body accident.
